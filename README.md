# ML-with-Python

## Description
This repository contains the code for a machine learning project implemented in Python. The project focuses on data analysis and prediction using various machine learning algorithms.  
Firstly import all the relevant libraries and the dataset. After that perform exploratory data analysis, data manipulation and preprocessing to insure high quality input for machine learning algorithms.  
Generating and implementing various machine learning models using Python. Evaluating and fine-tuning machine learning models to improve their predictive accuracy and performance. Utilizing Python's visualization libraries to effectively communicate findings and present data-driven recommendations.  
  
The code provided in this repository includes the necessary scripts and modules required to train and evaluate the machine learning models. Also the links to datasets are provided. 

ML Algorithms used in the projects are:  
1. Logictic Regression
2. Linear Regression
3. Random Forest Regression
4. XGBoost Regression
5. KNN
6. Random Forest Classifier
8. Decision Tree Classifier
9. Suport Vector Classifier
